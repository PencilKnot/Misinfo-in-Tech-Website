        <main> <!-- History of misinformation and consequences -->
            <p>Today, misinformation is considered by the <a href=https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517441113>World Economic Forum (WEF)</a> as one of the main threats to our society. However, misinformation is not just a recent threat. In fact, it has been a part of many major events through the ages!</p>
            
            <h3>Through the Centuries</h3>
            <p>Let's take a look at the impact of misinformation through time!</p>

            <h4>Augustus Octavian (32 B.C.)</h4>
                <img src="media/anthony_octavian_coins.jpg" alt="Examples of coins used by Octavian and Marc Anthony" width = "300">
                <br>
                <i>Examples of coins used by Octavian and Marc Anthony</i>
                <p>Octavian was at war with Marc Anthony about who would claim the position of Rome's ruler. As the Roman public did not wish to support a civil war, both sides used a variety of misinformation tactics to rally their troops. This included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Claims that Cleopatra was a foreign sorceress who seduced Marc Anthony</li>
                    <li>Anthony and Cleopatra claimed that Octavian was of low birth, while Anthony was from Roman nobility</li>
                    <ul><li>This convinced 1/3 of the Roman Senate to defect to Anthony!</li></ul>
                    <li>Both sides used their own coins that depicted their close relationship to Julius Caesar</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the end, Octavian won the war. But this presents proof of the impact of information on people's beliefs.</p>
            <h4>Great Moon Hoax (1835)</h4>
                <img src="media\great_moon_hoax.jpg" alt="Illustration of life on the moon depicted in the articles" width = "300">
                <br>
                <i>Illustration of life on the moon depicted in the articles</i>
                <p>This hoax was created by Richard Adams Locke, where he claimed that astronomer Sir John Herschel had made several new discoveries of life on the Moon. In the series of the <i>Sun</i> newspaper articles, Locke described:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Men with bat wings</li>
                    <li>Unicorns and moon-bisons</li>
                    <li>Strange "slender pyramids" in irregular groups</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The catch? The articles were meant to be satirical, parodying reports that by other astronomers about the potential of life on the Moon. But the public believed it, and many religious groups even started making plans for missionary work on the Moon!</p>
            <h4>Stephen Glass Case (1972)</h4>
                <img src="media/shattered_glass.jpg" alt="Image of articles written by Stephen Glass" width = "300">
                <br>
                <i>Image of article written by Stephen Glass</i>
                <p>Stephen Glass was an up and coming reporter, writing articles for the largest magazines at the time, like New Republic, Rolling Stone and Harper's Magazine. These sensational stories took the world by storm, but the issue? They were all fake! Here are some of the extensive work Glass did to cover up his false stories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Filled notebooks with fake interview notes</li>
                    <li>Created fake business cards, phone lines and fake voicemails</li>
                    <li>Created fake websites and newsletters</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Glass was eventually caught when his article "Hack Heaven" was revealed to refer to companies that never existed. But for two and a half years, Glass published hundreds of articles that captured the world, despite facing many defamation lawsuits from companies he had lied about.</p>
