         <h3>Types of Misinformation</h3>
            <p>Misinformation comes in a variety of forms, and with the rise of the digital era it has become more widespread. Let's look at some types.</p>
         <h4>Satire</h4>
            <p>Satirical articles use humour and fictional stories to discuss social and political concepts. However, to sell the joke, many satirical websites like <a href=https://www.theonion.com>The Onion</a> and <a href=https://babylonbee.com>The Babylon Bee</a> are presented like a real news website, which can often lead to confusion among readers.</p>

            <i>Image of an example article from The Onion</i>
         <h4>Clickbait and Tabloids</h4>
            <p>In order to increase interest in their articles, some websites and tabloids use clickbait. Clickbait is sensationalized media (titles, images) which aims to encourage visitors to "click" on that article. They can incite the emotions of the reader and cause them to spread the content around, which can be extremely damaging when they contain fake news.</p>

         <h4>Propaganda</h4>
            <p>Propaganda is used to distort facts or contain lies with the goal of instilling a certain emotion, often belief towards a goal. It was often used during the World Wars to encourage a sense of patriotism among citizens.</p>

         <h4>Deepfakes</h4>
            <p>With the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes are the newest and likely most dangerous form of misinformation. New technology can allow people to generate images of fake events, or even of videos of people saying things they never did! This can make it incredibly difficult to visually distinguished between them.</p>
