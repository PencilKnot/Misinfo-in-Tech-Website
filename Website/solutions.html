            <h3>Methods of Detection</h3>
            <p>Nowdays, companies and governments are making efforts against misinformation. But what can you do to prevent yourself from falling into its trap? Luckily, there are several methods.</p>
            
            <h4>Four Moves and a Habit (SIFT)</h4>
            <p><a href=https://open.oregonstate.education/goodargument/chapter/four-moves-and-habit/>First proposed</a> by Mike Caulfield, the SIFT method contains four simple steps:</p>
            <img src="media/sift.png" alt="Visual representation of SIFT method" width="500">
            <ol>
                <li><i>Stop</i></li>
                <p>Before you read, <u>stop</u> and ask yourself if you trust the website or source of information.</p>
                <li><i>Investigate the Source</i></li>
                <p>Do research on who is providing the information, and how they could be related to the it (ex: video of benefits of milk consumption published by a milk company)</p>
                <li><i>Find Better Coverage</i></li>
                <p>Look through multiple sources about the topic. Consider the general consensus, not just the opinion from a single article.</p>
                <li><i>Trace Back to the Original Source</i></li>
                <p>Trace any video, quote or other media back to it's origin. Perhaps the video have been clipped, or the photo was taken in an entirely different context.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>For more details of how to use this method, check out these <a href=https://libguides.lib.cwu.edu/c.php?g=625394&p=4391900>examples</a>.</p>

            <h4>The CRAAP Test</h4>
            <p>
                The SIFT method is commonly used for everyday purposes, but when it comes to school assignments or more formal settings, the <a href=https://open.oregonstate.education/goodargument/chapter/craap-test/>CRAAP Test</a> can be used. Consider the following questions:
            </p>
            <img src="media/craap_test.png" alt="Visual representation of CRAAP test" width="500">
            <ol>
                <li><i>Currency (C)</i></li>
                <p>How recent is the text?</p>
                <li><i>Relevance (R)</i></li>
                <p>How closely related to your topic is the text? Is it directly related?</p>
                <li><i>Accuracy (A)</i></li>
                <p>How accurate is this text? Is there any reason to doubt it's validity?</p>
                <li><i>Authority (A)</i></li>
                <p>Who is the source of this information (author, publisher)? How do their credentials relate to the topic?</p>
                <li><i>Purpose (P)</i></li>
                <p>What is the text trying to achieve, and does this purpose influence their credibility?</p>
            </ol>
            <p>When it comes to global events or news, consider fact-checking websites such as <a href=https://www.snopes.com>Snopes</a>, <a href=https://www.factcheck.org>FactCheck.org</a> and <a href=https://www.politifact.com>Politifact</a>. Remember, always think twice before trusting anything online! </p>
